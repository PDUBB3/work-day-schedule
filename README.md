## What did we do?

Create files from scratch our selves
include the following elements into our portfolio:

- [x] The current day is displayed at the top of the calender, when opened
- [x] When I scroll down, time blocks are shown for standard business hours
- [x] When I view the time blocks for that date, the colour is coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.
- [x] When I click onto a time bloc, i can enter an event
- [x] When I click the save button, the text for that event is saved in local storage
- [x] When i refresh the page, the saved events persist
